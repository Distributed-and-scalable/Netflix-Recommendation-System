## Executive Summary

It will be more frustrating when we are not able to find something interesting to watch. Providing customers with recommendations has become a core part of the digital entertainment industry. Knowing the importance of recommendations on the entertainment industry, we are planning to replicate and also try to improve the ability of the recommendation algorithms. To provide movie recommendations, we have selected the Netflix which is one of the prominent platforms of OTT. 

We are planning to use the data generated in the past by the customers to provide recommendations to the customers. Data like movie ratings, personal preferences, and movie release dates will be used to design the algorithm.

## Abstract

The main objective of the project is to analyze and understand the insights from Netflix. This project intends to use the concepts of Cloud Computing and PySpark. Pearson Correlation Coefficient, Alternating Least Squares metrics, and Collaborative Filtering will be used on Netflix data to achieve the goal with the assistance of PySpark. Knowledge and support of Machine Learning Technologies, and Python libraries like Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, etc. will be used to accomplish the tasks in the project.

## Introductory Section

Progress in data science has had an impact on the manner in which we convey, share, and get data. Consider how big data has changed our television and film encounters. Organizations like Netflix gather great data on various interests from various places to make recommendations for clients with the assistance of a tool known as recommender engines. The requirement for suggestion engines and personalization is a consequence of a phenomenon known as the "era of abundance". We have a huge variety of decisions in light of huge amounts of data that are accessible through the Web.
