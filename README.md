# Netflix-Recommendation-System

The main objective of the project is to analyze and understand the insights from Netflix.

## Executive Summary
It will be more frustrating when we are not able to find something interesting to watch. Providing customers with recommendations has become a core part of the digital entertainment industry.
Knowing the importance of recommendations on the entertainment industry, we are planning to replicate and also try to improve the ability of the recommendation algorithms. To provide movie recommendations, we have selected the Netflix which is one of the prominent platforms of OTT. 

We are planning to use the data generated in the past by the customers to provide recommendations to the customers. Data like movie ratings, personal preferences, and movie release dates will be used to design the algorithm.
